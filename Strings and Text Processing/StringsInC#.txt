Problem 1. Strings in C#.

-Describe the strings in C#.
Strings are sequences of characters. Each character is a Unicode symbol represented by the string data type in C# (System.String). String objects are like arrays of characters (char[]).Have fixed length (String.Length). Elements can be accessed directly by index in the range [0...Length-1].
-What is typical for the string data type?
String objects contain an immutable (read-only) sequence of characters.After being assigned once, the content of the variable does not change directly.If we try to change the value, it will be saved to a new location in the dynamic memory and the variable will point to it. Strings use the Unicode table to support multiple languages and alphabets.
-Describe the most important methods of the String class.
Main methods:
Clone()	Make clone of string.
CompareTo()	Compare two strings and returns integer value as output. It returns 0 for true and 1 for false.
Contains()	The C# Contains method checks whether specified character or string is exists or not in the string value.
EndsWith()	This EndsWith Method checks whether specified character is the last character of string or not.
Equals()	The Equals Method in C# compares two string and returns Boolean value as output.
GetHashCode()	This method returns HashValue of specified string.
GetType()	It returns the System.Type of current instance.
GetTypeCode()	It returns the Stystem.TypeCode for class System.String.
IndexOf()	Returns the index position of first occurrence of specified character.
ToLower()	Converts String into lower case based on rules of the current culture.
ToUpper()	Converts String into Upper case based on rules of the current culture.
Insert()	Insert the string or character in the string at the specified position.
IsNormalized()	This method checks whether this string is in Unicode normalization form C.
LastIndexOf()	Returns the index position of last occurrence of specified character.
Length	It is a string property that returns length of string.
Remove()	This method deletes all the characters from beginning to specified index position.
Replace()	This method replaces the character.
Split()	This method splits the string based on specified value.
StartsWith()	It checks whether the first character of string is same as specified character.
Substring()	This method returns substring.
ToCharArray()	Converts string into char array.
Trim()	It removes extra whitespaces from beginning and ending of string.
